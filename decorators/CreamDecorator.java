/**
 * Concrete decorator that adds cream to a cake.
 *
 * <p>This decorator wraps a {@link Cake} instance and enhances its description
 * by appending "with Cream" and increases the cost by a fixed amount.
 * It follows the Decorator pattern to add features without modifying the base cake.
 *
 * <p>Example usage:
 * <pre>
 * Cake base = new ChocolateCake(1, "Large", 12.50);
 * Cake decorated = new CreamDecorator(base);
 * System.out.println(decorated.describe()); // "Order #1: Chocolate Cake (Large) with Cream"
 * System.out.println(decorated.getCost()); // 14.50
 * </pre>
