 * Abstract base class for cake decorators following the Decorator pattern.
 * 
 * <p>This class wraps a {@link Cake} instance and delegates method calls to it,
 * allowing concrete decorators to enhance the cake's description and cost without
 * modifying the original cake object.
 * 
 * <p>Concrete decorators (e.g., ChocolateChips, Cream, Skittles) extend this
 * class and provide their decoration name and cost via abstract getter methods.
 * Both the description grammar logic and cost calculation are centralized here.
 * 
 * <p>The decoration cost and name are read from static fields in each concrete
 * decorator class, allowing them to be changed and affecting all instances of
 * that decorator class.
