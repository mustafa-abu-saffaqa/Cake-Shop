 * Concrete decorator that adds chocolate chips to a cake.

 * to the total price.
 * 
 * <p>Example usage:
 * <pre>
 * Cake base = new ChocolateCake(1, "Large", 12.50);
 * Cake decorated = new ChocolateChipsDecorator(base);
 * // Result: "Order #1: Chocolate Cake (Large) with Chocolate Chips"
 * // Cost: 12.50 + 2.50 = 15.00
 * </pre>
